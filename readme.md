# DewPress

**Under construction, stay tuned for more features.**

Vue based server-side generated websites.

This is a project used to generate fully themable websites using vue, vite, ssg and markdown.

It is heavily based on vitepress with the exception that this tool aims at
creating fully informative websites according to Jamstack.

## Minimum dependencies
This project aims to have a minimum dependency footprint in your project. At this time the only extra dependency you get when installing
dewpress is Vite. Everything else will be built into the dewpress scripts. 

The reason to include Vite as a dependency is that it provides powerful tooling for your own development and enables you to use this
tool in whatever awesome project you are currently using dewpress to build.

Dewpress will aim to always provide a range of supported Vite versions, but this will ofcourse depend on the
developments of Vite itself. I guess time will tell how well this will work in practice.
