# DewPress

Welcome to DewPress, the Jamstack inspired Static Site Generator based on Vite and Markdown.

This page describes the first stuff to know about DewPress. It is intended as a framwork to enable
Jamstack based websites. It is completely unopinionated and flexible in design. Its sole concern
is to enable website generation from Markdown.

## Optional Hydration
You can choose whether to enable a Single Page Application or not. It is also possible to leave 
your website as list of static html files. It performs slightly worse as it will always need to perform a full
page reload on navigation, but the choice is yours to make.
